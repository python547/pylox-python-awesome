# pylox

Python implementation of the Lox language from Robert Nystrom's Crafting Interpreters.
https://craftinginterpreters.com.    This only implements the tree-walking interpreter in Part 1.

## Notes

This is not a teaching exercise. I provide no commentary beyond the code itself
and will likely implement using parser-generator tools.
