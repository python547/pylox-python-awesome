# pylox

Python implementation of the Lox language from Robert Nystrom's Crafting Interpreters.
https://craftinginterpreters.com.   This only implements the tree-walking interpreter in Part 1.

## Notes

This is not a teaching exercise. I provide no commentary beyond the code itself.

The implementation does not directly follow the implementation in the
book.  I rely upon parser generation tools and use programming idioms
specific to Python.  I am trying to implement the same semantics for Lox
as are described in the book.
